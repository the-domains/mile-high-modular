  System level design also improves performance and lowers cost. Local voltage
  regulation and Star grounding on and between modules means a low noise floor
  and no parasitic modulations or interactions such as oscillator locking.
  Distributing costs like circuit boards, panels and power connectors across
  multiple elements dramatically lowers per element cost.
